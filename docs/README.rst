Leerstandsmelder Zwo
====================

This is the new Leerstandsmelder.


This software package is a module for `Isomer <https://github.com/isomeric/isomer>`__.

It comes with its own full frontend. Most of Isomer's old frontend technology will be
rebuilt with new technology for this package and parts will be reused in the new
generalized, next generation Isomer frontend.
